## Notes & Decisions

### Oct 24, 2025 - Evening Session

- **Decision**: Use unpinned dependencies for development flexibility
- **Note**: Gemini 2.5 Flash Image (Nano Banana) better than DALL-E for NotebookLM style
- **Decision**: Process sources sequentially for MVP, add queue later
- **Fixed**: Windows-specific issues with bash scripts - created PowerShell alternatives
- **Fixed**: NPM registry authentication - switched to public registry
- **Decision**: Keep setup simple - no Docker for initial development
- **Note**: Backend runs on port 8000, frontend on 5173
- **Decision**: Use SQLite for MVP (already configured)

### Technical Stack Confirmed

- **Backend**: FastAPI + Uvicorn + SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: React 18.3.1 + Vite 5.4.10 + TailwindCSS
- **Video**: Remotion 4.0.246 + FFmpeg
- **AI**: Google Gemini 0.8.3 + Google Cloud TTS
- **Database**: SQLite (development) ‚Üí PostgreSQL (production)

---

## Metrics

**Lines of Code**: ~500 (setup files, routers, config)
**Files Created**: 25+
**Test Coverage**: 0% (testing not started)
**API Response Time**: Not measured yet
**Video Generation Time**: Not implemented yet

---

## Development Environment Status

‚úÖ **Working**:

- Python 3.13 virtual environment
- FastAPI server on http://localhost:8000
- API docs on http://localhost:8000/docs
- React dev server on http://localhost:5173
- All dependencies installed

‚ùå **Not Yet Working**:

- Database (tables not created)
- File uploads (storage not implemented)
- Video generation
- Frontend UI (placeholder only)

## Next Session Plan

### Priority 1 (Must Do)

1. Create `backend/app/services/document_processor.py`
2. Implement PDF extraction with PyPDF2
3. Implement DOCX extraction with python-docx
4. Test with sample documents
5. Create database tables with Alembic migration

### Priority 2 (Should Do)

6. Create `backend/app/services/gemini_service.py`
7. Test Gemini API connection
8. Implement basic script analysis

### Priority 3 (Nice to Have)

9. Create basic upload form in frontend
10. Add file validation
11. Display upload status
